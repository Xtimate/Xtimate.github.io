            <p>Hello, my name is Xtimate and i just started discovering programming again and thought this website would work well as a starting project as i learned CSS and HTML before. I first started to discover coding when i was 8 years old and was bored. Then i took programming classes organized by school and learned HTML and CSS but then i didn't code for while so i forgot most of it, now i started learning again from websites and its going pretty well.</p>
